TDFS: Time Domain File System

== What is This? ==

Based on unionfs-fuse this makes 'time domain file system' that
enables file coordination method described by Dr. Noguchi (a.k.a. 超整
理法 -- I don't know official translation, maybe super organization
method?).  The principle of the method is very simple:

- Make a folder (directory) for each of a period of time
  (e.g. every Month)
- If you need to access a file, search from the newest folder and 
  go back to past chronologically
- If you found a file you need, move it to the newest folder
- You may drop or archive the oldest folder if you need more space

With TDFS, you can get the benefits of 超整理法. Version 1.0 of TDFS
*will* do:

- unionfs-like file access to $(ROOT)/YYYY/MM directories
  (real filesystem)
- mounted dir gives newest N months files
- copy-on-write by default: all updated files will be copied to
  newest directory
