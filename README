TDFS: Time Domain Union File System

== What is This? ==

Based on unionfs-fuse, this makes 'time domain file system' that
enables a document management method described by Dr. Noguchi
(a.k.a. 超整理法 -- I don't know official translation, maybe "super
organization method" ?).  The principle of the method is very simple:

- Make a folder (directory) for each of a period of time
  (e.g. every Month)
- If you need to access a file, search from the newest folder and 
  go back to past chronologically
- If you found a file you need, move it to the newest folder
- You may drop or archive the oldest folder if you need more space

With TDFS, you can get the benefits of 超整理法. Version 1.0 of TDFS
will do:

- unionfs-like file access to $(ROOT)/YYYY/MM directories
- mounted dir gives newest N months files at a single view
- copy-on-write by default: all updated files will be copied to
  newest directory

This project is based on unionfs-fuse and licensed under BSD license.
(90% of the files are as same as unionfs-fuse)

== BUGS/WISHES ==

- You need to restart the process every month.
  (no dynamic self-reconfiguration yet -- anyway it may make things
   strange -- how can I do for ever-open files?)

- Read files are not copied to newest workdir -- this is different
  from the original method. Do we need copy-on-read in addition to
  copy-on-write? (but other processes such as nautilus will read
  the files to make thumbnails, etc.)

- Does not automatically make YYYY part (for now).
